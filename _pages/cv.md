## Research Experiences

* **AI-Enhanced Plasmonic Gold-Silicon Schottky Junction Photodetector Design**<br>
Supervisor: XIAOLI JI, Professor, NJU<br>
Sep 2024 -Present<br>
• Utilized machine learning algorithms to optimize the design of plasmonic photodetectors, improving quantum
efficiency by selecting optimal structural parameters using neural networks and particle swarm optimization
(PSO).<br>
• Generated a comprehensive dataset for FDTD simulations using Lumerical API, employing Python to automate
the parameter generation and simulation process.<br>
• Built and trained MLP neural network models to predict absorption efficiency based on structural parameters,
significantly reducing the design iteration time.

Supervisor: QINGYUAN ZHAO, Professor, NJU<br>
Aug 2024 -Present<br>
• Led a team of 4 members in developing a high-resolution blood flow meter based on SNSPD (Superconducting
Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors) to enhance measurement precision in medical applications.<br>
• Designed and implemented an optical pathway using SNSPD to measure diffuse reflectance spectra of human
tissue under 1064/1550 nm laser sources.<br>
• Developed regression algorithms (LSTM, least squares, and Nth-order linear models) to extract blood flow
indices from the temporal optical field’s cross-correlation function.
