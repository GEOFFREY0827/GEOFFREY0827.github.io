<h2>Research Experiences
======
* **AI-Enhanced Plasmonic Gold-Silicon Schottky Junction Photodetector Design**<br>
Supervisor: XIAOLI JI, Professor, NJU<br>
Sep 2024 -Present<br>
• Utilized machine learning algorithms to optimize the design of plasmonic photodetectors, improving quantum
efficiency by selecting optimal structural parameters using neural networks and particle swarm optimization
(PSO).
• Generated a comprehensive dataset for FDTD simulations using Lumerical API, employing Python to automate
the parameter generation and simulation process.
• Built and trained MLP neural network models to predict absorption efficiency based on structural parameters,
significantly reducing the design iteration time.

* **AI-Enhanced SNSPD-Based Cross-Correlation Spectral Flow Meter**<br>
Supervisor: QINGYUAN ZHAO, Professor, NJU<br>
Aug 2024 -Present<br>
• Led a team of 4 members in developing a high-resolution blood flow meter based on SNSPD (Superconducting
Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors) to enhance measurement precision in medical applications.
• Designed and implemented an optical pathway using SNSPD to measure diffuse reflectance spectra of human
tissue under 1064/1550 nm laser sources.
• Developed regression algorithms (LSTM, least squares, and Nth-order linear models) to extract blood flow
indices from the temporal optical field’s cross-correlation function.

* **Temperature Control System Based on GM Cryocooler**<br>
Supervisor: QINGYUAN ZHAO, Professor, NJU<br>
Mar 2024- Aug 2024<br>
• Designed and implemented an automated closed-loop temperature control system for superconducting quantum
device testing, achieving precise control from 40K to 2.5K with 0.05K accuracy, surpassing the capabilities of
commercial systems (e.g., Lakeshore Model 211).
• Developed instrument control software using SCPI instructions and RS232/USB interfaces to automate the
operation of multiple devices, including Keysight DP832, Lakeshore Model 211, and Keysight SourceMeter
SM2450.
• Utilized PID control combined with fuzzy logic and Kalman filtering to achieve precise temperature control and
enhance system stability
