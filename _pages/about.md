I'm currently a senior student from [School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/ese_en/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). I'm going to earn my B.S. degree in Microelectronics Science and Engineering in 2026. I am interested in embedded system, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.  

In the past few years, I have been very fortunate to be advised by a lot of professors with outstanding academic abilities and educational enthusiasm. Which allows me to explore wide range of topics in computer science and electrical engineering. Here are the topics and projects I have participated in:

|Topics                        |Projecs                                                                 |Metor                                      |

|embedded system               |AI-based electrocardiogram diagnostic device based on Renesas RA8D1 MCU |Yina Zhou(ESE, Nanjing University)         |
|quantum computing             |Qubit control & readout using Quantum Machine                           |Dafei Jin(PHY, University of Notre Dame)   |
|artificial intelligence       |DNN and PSO algorithm enhanced semiconducting device design             |Xiaoli Ji(ESE, Nanjing University)         |
|superconducting device        |GM croycoller PID temperaturer control system & SNSPD application       |Qingyuan Zhao(ESE, Nanjing University)     |

**I am now seeking master degree and phd position in 2026 fall.** I'd strongly appreciate it if you could consider me!

## Technical Skills

* **Embedded System Oriented**: C, C++, freeRTOS, linux, interface(GPIO,UART,IIC,SPI,BUS...)
* **Artificial Intelligence Oriented**: python, PyTorch, sci-kit_learn, git, conda
* **Quantum computing Oriented**: QUA, Quantum Machine
* **Paper writing**: LaTeX, Markdown


I am striving to improve my skills in computer science and engineering, and I am learning more quantum physics as well.
