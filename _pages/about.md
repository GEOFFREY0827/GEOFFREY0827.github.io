I am currently a senior student at the [School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/ese_en/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/), majoring in **Microelectronics Science and Engineering**. I will earn my B.S. degree in 2026. My research interests lie in **embedded systems**, **artificial intelligence**, and **quantum computing**.

Over the past few years, I have been fortunate to be advised by several professors with outstanding academic vision and educational enthusiasm. With their guidance, I have explored a variety of topics across computer science and electrical engineering. Some representative topics and projects include:
