I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student from [School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/ese_en/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). I'm going to earn my B.S. degree in Microelectronics Science and Engineering in 2026. I am interested in machine learning, digital circuit design, and superconducting electronics.  

In the past few years, I have been very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qingyuan Zhao](https://sccm.nju.edu.cn/21/e8/c32058a467432/page.htm) of Superconducting Quantum Devices and Photon Information Lab and Prof. [Xiaoli Ji](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/jxl_24120/list.htm) from School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University.<br>
**I am now seeking summer research opportunities in 2025 summer.** I'd strongly appreciate it if you could consider me!
